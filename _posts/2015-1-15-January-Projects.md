Over the holidays I read a blog post where someone was answering how they are so productive and the response is they don't want to waste a week.  So every week they work on something that moves them towards their goal. I thought this was an excellent idea so I've been started playing with different projects every weekend to play with different ideas, technologies and the like.  Keeping it small, try a tutorial or play with an idea.

So what have I been up to this month?

- Elastic search.  I started with this tutorial <Link> for using Elasitic Search to index my gmail.  On the way I started a new server and go a grip on how to use Elastic Search.  Pretty powerful tool that I'm still figuring out ways to employ.  Full-text search was a no brainer but seeing some of the aggregation capabilities was pretty interesting.  Looking to see if I can use that on projects that summarize data.

- iBeacon/Raspberry Pi.  
I've had a Raspberry Pi sitting around and I've been meaning to do something interesting with it for awhile.  I sat down one weekend and loaded the latest Raspbian image and went to town.  I created a new machine called PiBot.Had some fun getting back down in the Linux weeds.  I had picked up a Bluetooth LE USB adapter that I was able to get running.  Took me a few tries to realize that the bluez, the bluetooth library that comes with debian/raspbian doesn't support LTE.  I got that rolling and am pretty happy with the results.

- Responsive Web
I've also started carving out web stuff again, with some small changes to personal websites using skeleton for Responsive design.  This I think will be a launch point to help me write new applications.  I've started looking at mixing and matching items together.  I'm working on a new project to try and build a home dashboard on the PiBot.  The goal is to keep learning and find new ways to play.
