Writing is a good way to think through problems.  It provides a guiding force for organizing a thought and getting into a coherent format.  It creates a vector to inform others of the thought process you work through and the ideas you're working from.  A lot of the learning I've been doing of late has been squirreled away in an increasingly lossy head.  Sharing to get it out of the head and be of a bit of use to someone else.
