title: Happy New Year

Off to a bunch of goals for this year, the first being to get into a blogging habit.  I'm going to try to take on projects I can write about here.  For my first, I've launched a post today on recovering a harddrive from a Seagate Central NAS.  Little bits of linux work,but a nice small project that I thought should be written up. 

My holiday projects have been turning up well.  Did a bunch of coding in Swift in preparation to relaunch Library List.  Also looking to build up some additional Android chops this year.  I wrote up my Elasticsearch/Nginx/Oauth project, and I got a bit more work done on that to start capturing production data.

I have a few days left, I'm going to try and get some interesting coding before I have to get back to work projects, but I hope to post at least a project a quarter as the year goes on.
