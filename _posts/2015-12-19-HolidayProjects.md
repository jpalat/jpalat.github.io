I'm taking some time off before the end of the year to spend some time with my family, but also to scratch the itch of taking care of a couple of projects that I've had in mind for awhile.  Some of these are work related, others will be personal projects I've wanted to get to for some time.  In any case I plan to document them here and get some practice blogging while I'm at it.  Stay tuned!
