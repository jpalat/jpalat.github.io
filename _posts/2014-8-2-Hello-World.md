Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com) I'm writing post about my working set.  More of an exercise to let me examine what my working set it.

*Who are you? What do you do?*
I'm Jay Palat. I'm a Dad, Husband, Son, Brother, Friend and Enemy.  I write software and bunch of other stuff too. I've worked at all sorts of places, from IBM to ModCloth.  I've built

*What hardware do you use*
At the office I have 2011 13" MacBook Pro.  It's pre-retina and has a non-SSD hd, but it does the job.  I did boost the RAM up to 16GB so that I could live with the mountains of tabs and applications I keep running.

At home I use a 2010 MacBook Air.  This device changed the game for me.  Compared to this, the Pro seems like a brick beast.  I was slower to adapt to the iPad 2 because the Air was light enought that I could be super productive on it.  The battery life was forever without sacrificing power.

I keep a iPhone 5s as my primary device.  The aforementioned iPad 2 floats around the house and I tend to share it with my daughter as we play games together.  I have an Android device -- a Nexus 7 Mk 2 that my team won at Steel City Code Fest. I'm not super in love with it, but it gives me motivation to work on Android.

*And what software?*

In 2003 I started running my laptops full time on Linux.  I loved the old school unix feel, but I got tired of fidgeting with setting when I was trying to get work done.  In 2007 my boss gave me a 17" MacBook Pro and the game changed.  OSX was the sweetest Unix system I'd ever seen.  Smooth, powerful and not much fiddling.  I'm currently on OSX Mavericks but I'm looking forward to Yosemite.  I enjoy the power of Terminal and iTerm.  

For Coding, I tend to be writing XCode for Objective C Projects.  I tend to use VIM.
